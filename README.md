# Hello ☁️

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Capital One. Before this role, I was leading the feature
development and deployment of our 7-Eleven's first self-checkout platform in the U.S.

Lately, my focus has been on frontend architecture, state management, and
optimizing high-performance applications at scale. I also love building
developer tools—like Figma and Flipper plugins—to support my team.

# Hello ☁️

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer & Team Lead** at 7-Eleven, leading the
**feature development and deployment** of **7-Eleven’s first self-checkout
platform in the U.S.** I specialize in **React, React Native, Redux, TypeScript,
Kotlin, and Android**.

Lately, my focus has been on **frontend architecture, state management, and
optimizing high-performance applications at scale.**

I also love building developer tools—like **Figma and Flipper plugins**—to
support my team!

Thanks for stopping by :)

# Hello ☁️

I'm a software engineer based in Brookyln.

Right now, I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at Capital One. Before this role, 
I was at 7-Eleven leading the development of their first self checkout platform in the U.S.

Lately, my focus has been on frontend architecture, state management, and
optimizing high-performance applications at scale. I also love building
developer tools—like Figma and Flipper plugins—to support my team.
